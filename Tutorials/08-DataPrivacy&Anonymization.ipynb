    "\n",
    "Much of the logic Safe Harbor (and/or Data Anonymization in general) is to remove any unique information that could be used to identify you. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is most obvious for things like names, but some of the seemingly weirder specifications of Safe Harbour also relate to this idea - so while it may be innocuous to talk about a 37 year old male who lives in Los Angeles, it might actually be quite obvious who the person is when talking about a 37 year old male who lives in Potrero, California, a town of about 700 people. This is the same reason ages above 90 have to be removed - even in a fairly large area, say San Diego, it may be fairly obvious who the 98 year old female participant is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically - any information that makes you stand out is liable to identify you, and so anonymization attempts to squash these idiosyncracies from data that needs to be anonymized.  This also underlies the difficulty in protecting data in the face of multiple data sources, since collecting observations together makes starts to pick out people more uniquely - so it may still be relatively easy to identify the 37 year old male from LA if you also happen to know (or figure out) that he has a poodle, is 5'6\", works at UCLA, and was at Griffith Park on Saturday, April 15th.
